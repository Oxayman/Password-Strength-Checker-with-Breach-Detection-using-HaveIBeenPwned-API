# Password-Strength-Checker-with-Breach-Detection-using-HaveIBeenPwned-API

This project aims to create a secure, user-friendly web-based password strength checker that evaluates password robustness and alerts users if their password has been compromised in known data breaches. The tool combines client-side JavaScript logic to evaluate strength criteria (length, case, numbers, symbols) and integrates HaveIBeenPwned’s free public API to detect password reuse or leaks using a privacy-friendly kanonymity method. This project demonstrates a real-world use of security practices, browser cryptographic APIs, and public data services to promote better user password hygiene. 

Objectives 

Build a password checker that shows real-time strength feedback, Warn users if their password is found in public breach databases and Use modern web technologies and maintain privacy
